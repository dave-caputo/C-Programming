CHAPTER 2: INTRO NOTES:
- `Variables` and `constants` are the basic data objects manipulated in a program.
- `Declarations` list the variables to be used, and state what type they have and, perhaps, their initial values.
- `Operators` specify what is to be done to them.
- `Expressions` combine variables and constants to produce new values.
- The `type` of an object determines the set of values it can have and what operations can be performed on it.

NOTES:
- The first character of a variable name should be a letter.
- The underscore `_` counts as a letter.
- Don't begin variable names with underscore, because the library routines often use such names.
- Use lower case for variable names and upper case for symbolic constants.
- At least the first 31st characters of an internal name are significant. For function names and external variables
   the number maybe less than 31 because external names may be used by assemblers and loaders over which the the
   language has no control (The ANSI standard guarantees uniqueness up to six characters and a single case).
- Use `shorter` names for local variables and `longer` names for external variables.
